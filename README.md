# AnimationsV4

Currently battling to get this working as I want. Have an open Q on SO (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43384107/update-hostbinding-angular-4-animation). Any help much appreciated.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 

If you want to use another port add the flag --port (i.e. ng serve --open --port 4500).
